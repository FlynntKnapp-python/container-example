# Container Example

GitHub Copilot: `__init__` is a special method in Python classes that is used to initialize objects of that class. It is called a constructor method because it is called when an object of the class is created.

In the `Container` class you provided, the `__init__` method takes one argument, `name`, and initializes two instance variables, `name` and `volume`, with default values of `name` and `0`, respectively. The `__init__` method also prints two messages to the console, one before and one after initializing the instance variables.

When you create an instance of the `Container` class, the `__init__` method is automatically called with the arguments you provide. In the example code you provided, two instances of the `Container` class are created, `box` and `bag`, with the names "jack in the box" and "carry on bag", respectively. When each instance is created, the `__init__` method is called with the corresponding name argument, and the instance variables `name` and `volume` are initialized. Finally, the `__str__` method is called to print a string representation of each instance.
